# Module-2-Challenge
# Portfolio

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill part-time or full-time positions. This portfolio is designed to highlight your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

## Project Overview
This challenge focuses on building a responsive portfolio webpage using **flexbox**, **media queries**, and **CSS variables**. It includes placeholder applications and images, which can be updated with real projects later in the course.

## User Story
AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position  

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio, THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application, THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (including Flexbox, CSS variables, and media queries)

## Features
- A responsive design that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
- Navigation links that scroll to the correct section of the page.
- Images that link to deployed applications.

## Grading Requirements

- **Portfolio Background Images (10%)**: Five portfolio images added as background images.
- **Navigation Links (10%)**: A navigation link for each section.
